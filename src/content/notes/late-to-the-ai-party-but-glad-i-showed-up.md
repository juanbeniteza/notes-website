title: Late to the AI Party, But Glad I Showed Up

I have to admit it: I arrived very late to the AI party. Aside from using ChatGPT to help me with diet plans, workout routines, or even travel itineraries, I hadn’t really found it that useful in my day-to-day work as a developer.

Still, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was falling behind. Friends and coworkers kept mentioning how they were using AI daily—for work, for chores, for everything. When I finally decided to dig a bit deeper, I realized this whole thing goes way beyond ChatGPT. There are models, LLMs, Claude, agents, prompts, Cursor... a whole universe of tools that made me think: am I really getting left behind?

That pushed me to start learning more—especially about the tools that could help me as a developer. And that’s how I found Cursor. Honestly, I was blown away. Just telling it in a few words that I wanted a simple API, and watching it build it in seconds, was both exciting and a little scary.

The worry is obvious: will AI eventually take my job? I think it’s clear that as these models evolve, they’ll get better and better at generating quality code. But at the end of the day, they’re still machines—limited by the prompts we give them.

What really got me excited, though, was the realization that all those app ideas, side projects, MVPs I’ve been sitting on... they might actually become real now. And that’s awesome. Even this blog started as just an idea—and it was entirely built with the help of AI. Of course, I let Cursor handle most of the coding, so I don’t have a deep understanding of the implementation. But that was intentional—I just wanted to see what it could really do.

In conclusion: yes, AI is helping us. And I know I’ll keep using it to bring more of my ideas to life.

Welcome to your new notes collection! This page demonstrates how markdown content is rendered in your notes.

## Basic Formatting

You can create **bold** text or *italic* text easily. You can also create `inline code` or code blocks:

```javascript
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

## Lists

### Unordered Lists
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

### Ordered Lists
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Links and Images

You can add [links to websites](https://www.example.com) and embed images.

## Tables

| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   |
| Cell 3   | Cell 4   |

## Quotes

> This is a blockquote which is great for emphasizing important information.
